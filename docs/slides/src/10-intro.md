# Introduction

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="37%"}

**Cops And Thieves** (*cops and robbers*) is a strategic pursuit-and-evasion game where two opposing agent types operate in a shared environment. Thieves aim to evade capture, while cops patrol, chase, and arrest thieves to maintain order. The game mechanics involve agent coordination, pathfinding, and adaptive decision-making.

## Motivation

Comparison of other (probably better) approach for a problem considered previously on engineering studies course *Development Workshop*. Our project – [*Chase model*](https://github.com/mzsuetam/model-poscigowy-sp) – was also implementation of the cops and thieves game.

As depicted in [@fig:back], we are back to face the challenge of the cops and thieves problem, but this time with a different approach.
